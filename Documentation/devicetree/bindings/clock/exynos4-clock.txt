* Samsung Exynos4 Clock Controller

The Exynos4 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various controllers
within the Exynos4 SoC. The clock binding described here is applicable to all
SoC's in the Exynos4 family.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "samsung,exynos4210-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos4210 SoC.
  - "samsung,exynos4412-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos4412 SoC.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos4.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock: clock-controller@0x10030000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-clock";
		reg = <0x10030000 0x20000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@13820000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-uart";
		reg = <0x13820000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 54 0>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART2>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_UART2>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};

Exynos4412 clock controller contains some additional clocks for FIMC-ISP
(Camera ISP) subsystem. Registers for those clocks are partially located
in the SOC area, which belongs to ISP power domain. To properly handle
additional ISP clocks and their integration with power domains, an
additional subnode "isp-clock-controller" with "samsung,exynos4412-isp-clock"
compatible has to be defined under the main Exynos4 clock node. This subnode
can be then used for linking with respective ISP power domain (for more
information, see Samsung Exynos power domains bindings).

Example 3: An example of a clock controller for Exynos4412 with ISP clocks.

	clock: clock-controller@10030000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4412-clock";
		reg = <0x10030000 0x20000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;

		isp-clock-controller {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos4412-isp-clock";
			power-domains = <&pd_isp>;
		};
	};
